Default Google Map account
===========================

This tool is based on a similar tool for [Google Meet](https://github.com/nilbus/default-google-meet-account). The major goal is to incorporate certain function restricted G-suite accounts with other normal Google accounts (for example, seas.upenn.edu accounts are not authorized for using Google maps). 

Automatically redirect Google Map meetings to a URL with ?authuser=1

This extension is very simple: it defaults Google Meet to use your secondary Google account rather than the primary.

You can switch to other accounts if needed.
